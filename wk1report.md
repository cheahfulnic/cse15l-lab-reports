## Step 1: Installing VScode
1. Use this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to go to the VScode website and follow the instructions to install on your device.
2. Once installed (like I have done already!), open VScode. You should see something like the image below. 
* Don't worry if your's is in a different colour. Mine is in dark mode!

## Step 2: Remotely Connecting
1. Open up a new terminal by clicking on Terminal -> New Terminal in the menu bar.
2. Enter the following code (leaving out the $)
> $ ssh cs15lwi23xxx@ieng6.ucsd.edu
* The xxx should be replaced by your own personal id (which can be found using this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php))
* The link above should also detail how to change your password for the course-specific account.
* Important tips: Choose 'NO' when asked to change your MyTritonLink password and "YES" when asked to change your course-specific account passwords.
